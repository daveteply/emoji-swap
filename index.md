### Header Discussion and Algorithm

#### Emoji use

I thought of using emojis due to their popularity, fun, and wide-spread compatibility. The first trick was to get the emoji to render on a web page based on its code.

Starting with the [Full Emoji List](https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html), the first emoji listed is `1F600` which is the 😀 or “grinning face”.  After some work, I discovered that this is how to render an emoji using Angular:

```
<div [innerHTML]="1F600"></div>
```
