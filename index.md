## Welcome to üò∫ Emoji Swap!

A causal game inspired by classic tile-matching games like Bejeweled and Candy Crush. This is an exercise in algorithmic tile matching and potential tile matching.

**[Demo](demo-0.1.9/)** Play the game!

### Discussion and Algorithm

#### Emoji Rendering

I thought of using emojis due to their popularity, fun, and wide-spread compatibility. The first trick was to get the emoji to render on a web page based on its code.

Starting with the [Full Emoji List](https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html), the first emoji listed is `1F600` which is the üòÄ or ‚Äúgrinning face‚Äù. After some work, I discovered that this is how to render an emoji using Angular:

```
<div [innerHTML]="&#x1F600"></div>
```

#### Game Board

The next bit of fun was to draw the game board or grid of emojis. I initially thought to use [CSS Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout), but decided that most breakpoints where going to be similar so good ole [Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox) did the trick!

Basic algorithm:

1. Start with a 2-D array in TypeScript ` grid: GameTile[][];`
2. Loop through each dimension's limit (row and column)
3. Add a `GameTile` from a random list of emojis
4. See: src\app\game\services\game.service.ts: `CreateGame(`

#### Finding Matches

For the game to function, I needed a mechanism that would quickly tell me if there existed a match on the board.  This mechanism would then be ready for any scenerio:
- after the game board was established
  - new game instance
  - level change
  - reshuffle
- after player interaction
- after a previously found match was removed and new tiles added
This would equip the game with the ability to react to any of the above events.
